# ink! Integration Tests

This folder contains a set of example contracts for ink!.
The main purpose of the examples in this folder is for testing ink!
end to end as part of the development/CI process. As such this
folder contains examples which are testing specific features, which
are distinct from real world examples.

We have an external repository for ink! contract examples:
[`ink-examples`](https://github.com/paritytech/ink-examples).

A large number of the examples in this folder can also be found
in this repository. The difference is that the contracts in this
folder may already contain unreleased breaking changes.

For end users it's better to take a look at the
[`ink-examples`](https://github.com/paritytech/ink-examples)
repository. The contracts in there are ensured to be running with
the latest published ink! version.

## License

The examples in this folder are released into the public domain.
We hope they help you build something great with ink!.
